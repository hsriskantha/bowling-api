# üé≥ Bowling API 
## üéØ Aims

- Using the Serverless framework, create an API that tracks the score for a (one-player) game of bowling. 
- To start with, you'll need to update the existing `/updateScore` endpoint.
- Store any data in memory for now. 
- Then, create another endpoint `/getScore` that should return the score.
- Note that this is deliberately a challenge that you're unlikely to finish!


## ‚úèÔ∏è A quick guide to scoring

- Within a frame, you have up to two rolls to knock down ten pins. 
- The number of pins you knock down is added to your score. 
- If you knock down all ten pins with two rolls (spare):
  - Your next roll is added to your score for this frame. 
- If you knock down all ten pins with your first roll (strike):
  - Your next two rolls are added to your score for this frame. 
  - You do not get your second roll within this frame. 
- In the tenth and final frame:
  - If you get a strike, you get two more rolls which are added to your score.
  - If you get a spare, you get one more roll which is added to your score. 
- Hence a perfect game can be completed in twelve rolls, for 300 points.


## üöÄ Running the Code

- Run serverless offline in another terminal using `yarn dev`
- You can then post to: `localhost:3000/dev/updateScore`
- You can post using curl, for example:
```
curl -X POST localhost:3000/dev/updateScore -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"frame": 1}'
```
- Or you can run unit tests using `yarn jest`.
